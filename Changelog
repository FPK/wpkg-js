Changes 2008-04-21, v1.0.2 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
NEW: Improved handling of event log system errors. In case writing to event log
     causes an exception WPKG will not exit silently any more but fall back to
     write to STDOUT and log to the log file as appropriate (depending on log
     level). Thanks to Brian May for reporting and debugging.
     This fixes Bug 109.


Changes 2008-04-10, v1.0.1 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: Fixed Bug 107. Registry equality checks throw an error in case of checked
     value is of type REG_DWORD or REG_BINARY. Now the values are converted to
     strings before comparing it to the 'value' attribute. REG_MULTI_SZ and
     REG_BINARY values are concatenated using newline characters. For
     REG_BINARY values each octett is converted to its decinal number
     representation. Examples:
     REG_MULTI_SZ = a
                    b
                    c
     value = "a
     b
     c"
     will match.
     REG_BINARY values will be converted to multiline string as well. Each octett of the binary value
     is converted to its decimal representation.
     REG_BINARY = "11 22 33 44"
     value = "17
     34
     51
     68"
     will match.

MOD: Misleading/confusing info message about non-zero exit code (even if exit
     code was 0) changed from:
     Command '<cmd> returned non-zero exit code [<code>]. This exit code...
     to
     Command '<cmd>' returned exit code [<code>]. This exit code...
     The quoting has been fixed as well (see above).


Changes 2008-02-04, v1.0-RC9 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: WPKG crashed when /force was used in conjunction with /synchronize. Fixed.
MOD: WPKG was forced to exit if package checks failed after installation or if
     a package failed to remove. This has been changed. Now WPKG prints an
     error (unless /quitonerror is used).
     Note that installation of packages depending on the failed one will fail
     as well. Some packages require reboot unless checks yield true. Therefore
     it is crucial to define correct package reboot flags for such packages.

Changes 2008-02-18, v1.0-RC8 by Rainer Meier <r.meier (at) wpkg.org>
FIX: Included cosmetic fix for Bug 104 (opening quotation missing).
     This fix adds a missing opening quotation in debug output when a new
     package is added to the local settings node (after installation success).
FIX: Fixed Bug 103. /help screen is not showing up if config.xml is missing and
     null-pointer exception is thrown.

Changes 2008-01-14, v1.0-RC7 by Rainer Meier <skybeam (at) users.sourceforge.net>
FIX: Fixed Bug 96. Equality check on non-existing registry value yields an
     exception. The same could theoretically occur as well on IP-address
     evaluation. However there it's very unlikely to happen but I fixed it as
     well.

Changes 2007-01-08, v1.0-RC6 by Rainer Meier <skybeam (at) users.sourceforge.net>
FIX: The /noforcedremove parameter defaulted to "true" instead of "false" as
     documented within config.xml. Fixed.
     To make it clear: If neither the /noforcedremove flag is set or the
     noforcedremove property is set to true within config.xml it defaults to
     false.
NEW: Added /noremove flag to skip all package uninstallation actions.
     Allows to disable removing of packages. If used in conjunction with the
     /synchronize parameter it will just add packages but never remove them.
     Instead of removing a list of packages which would have been removed
     during that session is printed on exit. Packages are not removed from
     the local settings database (wpkg.xml). Therefore it will contain a list
     of all packages ever installed.
     Note that each package which is requested to be removed (manually or by
     a synchronization request) will be checked for its state by executing its
     included package checks. If the package has been removed manually it will
     also be removed from the settings database. Due to the fact that packages
     whithout checks always return 'false' for during the install-status check
     these packages will disappear from the local wpkg.xml.

Changes 2007-12-15, v1.0-RC5 by Rainer Meier <skybeam (at) users.sourceforge.net>
NEW: Support for 64-bit operating systems added. Tested on Windows Vista x64.
     WPKG will now be able to read the uninstall keys of 32- and 64-bit
     applications when run from 64-bit cscript.exe.
     NOTE: Unfortunately WPKG-client is purely 32-bit so it will run 32-bit
     cscript.exe. As a result there is no way to read the 64-bit native
     registry keys as well as accessing the 64-bit "Program Files" folder.
     To work around this I wrote a small wrapper script which invokes the
     64-bit cmd shell. Unfortunately the 64-bit binaries within
     %SystemRoot%\system32 (yes, really, Microsoft put the 64-bit binaries
     there!) are not accessible by 32-bit programs. So you need to copy it
     to another location. See instructions below (copied fromthe header of
     wrapper.js):

     Script which allows to execute WPKG within 64-bit environment (using
     64-bit cscript.exe) on 64-bit operating systems like Windows XP x64 or
     Windows Vista x64.

     How to install:
     - Put wrapper.js into the same directory where you run wpkg.js from
      e.g. \\server\RemInst\wpkg\wrapper.js
     - Put your 64-bit cmd.exe from %SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe to the 64-bit
       sub-folder:
       e.g. \\server\RemInst\wpkg\64-bit\cmd.exe
       NOTE: Make sure you really copy the 64-bit cmd.exe. Do not copy cmd.exe
       from %SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\cmd.exe since this is the 32-bit binary.
       Quite strange but Microsoft put all 64-bit binaries to system32 while
       all 32-bit binaries are located at SysWOW64.
       (WOW64 = Windows on Windows-64)
     - Configure WPKG-Client to run the wrapper instead while keeping all
       parameters.

     Directory structure:
     \\server\RemInst\wpkg
                        |- [XML files]
                        |- wpkg.js
                        |- wrapper.js
                        |- 64-bit
                              |- cmd.exe

     WPKG Client configuration:
     WPKG file path (required): \\server\RemInst\wpkg\wrapper.js
     WPKG parameters:           /synchronize

     IMPORTANT, IMPORTANT, IMPORTANT, IMPORTANT, IMPORTANT, IMPORTANT
     ================================================================
     File checks:
     If you use file checks within your 32-bit packages you have to check
     for %ProgramFiles(x86)%\file\path... as well since %ProgramFiles% will
     point to the install location of native 64-bit binaries and 32-bit
     binaries cannot be found there.
     To create a package which supports both (32/64-bit) systems I recommend
     using a logical "or" check. For example:
     <check type='logical' condition='or'>
     <check type='file' condition='versiongreaterorequal' path='%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Skype\Phone\Skype.exe' value='3.6.0.216' />
     <check type='file' condition='versiongreaterorequal' path='%ProgramFiles%\Skype\Phone\Skype.exe' value='3.6.0.216' />
     </check>

     Registry checks:
     Registry values of 32-bit applications are redirected to
     "HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\*". WPKG will try to look up each value directly
     at "HKLM\Software\*" first and in case it cannot find it it will look for
     the corresponding key within "Wow6432Node". Therefore you might check for
     "HKLM\Software\TortoiseSVN\AddedIcon" which will look up the 64-bit version
     on 64-bit Windows and the 32-bit version on 32-bit Windows.
     In case you installed only 32-bit TortoiseSVN on 64-bit Windows it will try
     to find the 64-bit key and if it fails read the one at
     "HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\TortoiseSVN\AddedIcon".

Changes 2007-12-06, v1.0-RC4 by Rainer Meier <skybeam (at) users.sourceforge.net>
FIX: Requires config.xml in order to run. This was due to the fact that a WPKG
     tries to resolve language strings from config.xml. Fixed. If config.xml is
     not available it will simply print english built-in messages.
     Fixes bug 87.

Changes 2007-12-06, v1.0-RC3 by Rainer Meier <skybeam (at) users.sourceforge.net>
FIX: Variable declaration yielded an error within packages, profiles and hosts.
     Fixes bug 83.

Changes 2007-11-24, v1.0-RC2 by Rainer Meier <skybeam (at) users.sourceforge.net>
NEW: Allows "true", "false" and "postponed" as a value of the reboot attribute
     within the package node. The states have the following effect:
     "true"      Immediate reboot after package installation.
                 This will take precedence of any command-level reboot="postponed"
                 attribute if present and reboot immediately after package
                 installation.
                 A reboot="true" attribute on command-level will still result in
                 an immediate reboot.
                 Resulting status depending on command-level reboot flag:
                 "true"      immediate reboot after command execution
                 "delayed"   reboot after package installation
                 "postponed" reboot after package installation
                 "false"     reboot after package installation
     "postponed" Schedule reboot after installing all packages within this
                 session, for example after synchronizing.
                 Resulting status depending on command-level reboot flag:
                 "true"      immediate reboot after command execution
                 "delayed"   reboot after package installation
                 "postponed" reboot after all actions are completed
                 "false"     reboot after all actions are completed
     "false"     No reboot unless one is defined at command-level.
     or not set  Resulting status depending on command-level reboot flag:
                 "true"      immediate reboot after command execution
                 "delayed"   reboot after package installation
                 "postponed" reboot after all actions are completed
                 "false"     no reboot

     As a result there are four possibilities to schedule a reboot in order of
     precedence:
     immediate   Command node specified reboot=true, immediate reboot takes place.
     package     Reboot is issued right after installing:
                 - package specifies reboot="true"
                   OR
                 - any command node specified reboot="delayed"
     postponed   Reboot will take place after all packages have been applied.
                 - package specifies reboot="postponed"
                   OR
                 - any command node specified reboot="postponed"
     none        No reboot is issued by this package:
                 - package does not specify reboot or specifies reboot="false"
                   AND
                 - no command node specified any form of reboot reboot

     This means that an immediate reboot always has the highest priority. You
     can just set "reboot markers" on a "timeline" on package and command level
     where the closest reboot marker will be executed:
     immediate => package => postponed => none

MOD: Exit code 0 is not any more automatically regarded as "successful" value.
     Even code 0 is now evaluated by exit code nodes. If no node is found it is
     still assumed that the command was successful. This allows administrators
     to schedule a reboot (immediate/delayed/postponed) even on exit code 0.

Changes 2007-11-24, v0.10.13 by Rainer Meier <skybeam (at) users.sourceforge.net>
NEW: Added ability to install packages by date.
     To use this feature an install/uninstall date has to be specified within
     the package node of the profile. Example:
     <package package-id="pkg" installdate="<date>" uninstalldate="<date>" />

     Note that a package can be referenced several times within different
     profiles. Each profile can specify its own install/uninstall date for a
     specific package (that's why it is not a property of the package itself).

     In case a host has multiple profiles assigned and the package is
     referenced from multiple profiles WPKG will evaluate all package
     references. If one of the references specify that the package has to be
     installed (or not date-range is specified at all), the package will be
     applied.

     Date is parsed in ISO 8601 format.
     See <http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime>.
     Generic format example:
        "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss"
     Valid date examples:
        (the following dates are all equal if ceil is set to false)
        "2007-11-23 22:00"          (22:00 local time)
        "2007-11-23T22:00"          (Both, "T" and space delimiter are allowed)
        "2007-11-23 22:00:00"       (specifies seconds which default to 0 above)
        "2007-11-23 22:00:00.000"   (specifies milliseconds which default to 0)
     It is allowed to specify the timezone as well:
        "2007-11-23 22:00+01:00"    (22:00 CET)
        "2007-11-23 21:00Z"         (21:00 UTC/GMT = 22:00 CET)
        "2007-11-23 22:00+00:00"    (21:00 UTC/GMT = 22:00 CET)

     If 'ceil' is set to true then unspecified date components do not fall back
     to "floor" (basically 0) but will be extended to the next value.
     This allows easy comparison if the current date is within a parsed "!ceil"
     date and a parsed "ceil" date.
     Examples:
     ceil=false:
        "2007-11-23"    => "2007-11-23 00:00:00"
        "2007-11"       => "2007-11-01 00:00:00"
     ceil=true:
        "2007-11-23"    => "2007-11-24 00:00:00"
        "2007-11"       => "2007-12-01 00:00:00"

     TIMEZONES:
     As specified by ISO 8601 the date is parsed as local date in case no
     time zone is specified. If you define a time zone then the specified time
     is parsed as local time for the given time zone. So if you specify
     "2007-11-23 22:00+05:00" this will be equal to "2007-11-23 18:00+01:00"
     while "+01:00" is known as CET as well. The special identifier "Z" is equal
     to "+00:00" time zone offset.

     Usually you will not specify any time zone at all since you might have a
     package installed at 08:00 local time rather than installing it at
     08:00 in UTC+1 time zone while it is installed at 15:00 in UTC+8 time
     zone (when specifying 07:00Z or 07:00+00:00 install time).

     Specifying an empty string as dateString is allowed and will results in
     returning the first of january 00:00 of the current year (ceil=false) or
     first of january 0:00 of the next year (ceil=true).

     This implements a feature on the TODO list.
MOD: Ordered functions by name and group (functionality, logging, supplementary).

Changes 2007-11-20, v0.10.12 by Rainer Meier <skybeam (at) users.sourceforge.net>
NEW: Added /ignoreCase switch which allows to disable case sensitivity of
     packages and profiles. Therefore you can assign the package "myapp" to a
     profile while only a package "MyApp" is defined within the packages.
     Note that this change requires modifying of the package/profile/host nodes
     read from the XML files. All IDs are converted to lowercase.
     Please note that this is a kind of one-way switch. Removing the switch
     later will cause all packages which use uppercase characters to fail
     looking up the local package node (which is stored in lowercase only).
     Fixes Bug 81.
NEW: Implemented change to allow multiple profiles to be specified within a
     host node (hosts.xml). The entries need to have the following format:
     <host name='hostname' profile-id='main-profile'>
        <profile id='profile1' />
        <profile id='profile2' />
     </host>
     The legacy "profile-id" is still used and preferred if you refer just
     to one single profile. However it is required to specify at least one
     valid profile which can be resolved within profiles.xml.
     WPKG will quit immediately if no profile can be resolved. Note that
     host definitions in the form of
     <host name='hostname' profile-id='main-profile' />
     are still allowed and preferred. Additionally the following is allowed
     as well:
     <host name='hostname'>
        <profile id='profile1' />
        <profile id='profile2' />
     </host>
     as long as at least one valid profile is referenced.
     Please note: If you use [PROFILE] within the logfile-template the names
     of all referenced profiles are concatenated in the form of
     <profile>[-profile[-profile]]
     Fixes Bug 53.
FIX: I noticed that I broke the code (again) that config.xml is entirely
     optional. As I added a parameter (/config:<path>) to specify the config
     file I decided that WPKG quits in case /config is used but the file
     cannot be found (assuming that you know what you're doing and there is
     probably something else going wrong so it's better to abort.
     In case /config is not used WPKG will not exit if config.xml cannot be
     located within the wpkg.js directory.
     In case of parsing errors it will quit immediately in any case.
MOD: Revised install procedure regarding the "execute" attribute of the
     package. Previously all pacakges were installed as if the execute
     attribute would have been set to "once" in pre-0.10.x releases.
     This means that packages with no execute flag were not checked at
     each run. This has been modified now. The execute flag has three
     states now:
     "always":
         No checks are executed. The package is installed no matter what
         its current install status is.

     "once":
         The package is installed once to the system and added to local
         settings database (wpkg.xml). If the package is within the local
         database it is checked if there is an upgrade available which will
         be installed. If no update is available the package is skipped.
         There are no checks executed to verify that the package is still
         installed. So this is faster than executing the checks but there is
         no verification of the install state done on each synchronize
         unless the /force switch is used which forces reinstalling even if
         the package has been installed already once.

     any other value (including missing attribute):
         The package is verified to be installed even if the package is
         within the local package database (wpkg.xml) which indicates that
         the package has been successfully installed once. This allows to
         actually verify the install state on each synchronize.
         If the checks yield true (package installed) and no new package
         version is available then the package is skipped (unless /force has
         been specified).
MOD: Improved error handling in case a referenced profile does not exist.
     Prints error and continues.

Changes 2007-11-19 by Rainer Meier <skybeam (at) users.sourceforge.net>
FIX: No change here but the redesign should fix Bug 57 (not installing
     packages whose dependencies failed to install).
     Fixes Bug 57.
FIX: No change here but the redesign should fix Bug 54 (dependency
     installation does not work).
     Fixes Bug 54.
FIX: No change here but the redesign already fixes Bug 52 (multiple wpkg.xml
     entries for one package when using /upgrade:<package>
     Fixes Bug 52.
NEW: Allows specifying of workdir='%WINDIR%\path\to\dir' attribute in
     package command nodes to specify the execution working directory.
     e.g.
     <install cmd='msiexec /i (path to msi)' workdir='%WINDIR%\system32' />
     Note: This works for install, upgrade and remove nodes.
     This fixes Bug 40.
MOD: Registry 'equals' conditions allows now to include variables like
     "%SystemRoot%". WPKG will now check if the registry value contains
     the given string. If it does not match it expands the string and
     checks again.
     This fixes Bug 47.
MOD: Packages are removed in reverse order (regarding priority).
     Note: Due to the new upgrade-before-remove feature all packages
     scheduled for removal are upgraded first. This upgrade is done in
     respect to the priority (highest priority first).
     Fixes Bug 24.
MOD: Exit node allows to specify code='any' now which matches any exit
     code. Specific exit codes still takes precedence. The user might
     specify the reboot=true/false/delayed flag for code='any' nodes as
     well.
MOD: Modified getHostVariables() to prevent null-pointer exception even
     if no dictionary is supplied. This has no effect on the current
     implementation but might prevent problems within future changes.

Changes 2007-11-19 by Rainer Meier <skybeam (at) users.sourceforge.net>
FIX: Fixed /noforcedremove. Now correctly disables forced removal.
FIX: Fixed trying to install package even if dependency failed. Now package
     installation aborts if installing of a dependency failed.
NEW: Added /config:<path> parameter which allows to specify an alternative
     configuration file location.
MOD: Removed duplicated usage-description (file-header, showUsage()) which
     made it difficutlt to keep them in-sync.
MOD: Re-organized usage help output. Now structured into three chapters:
     - package operations
     - optional parameters
     - testing parameters
     This hopefully helps to prevent scaring new users with lots of
     parameters while most of them are optional anyway.
MOD: 'config.xml' does not any more inject global variables into the code.
     Instead it's only allowed to overwrite defined variables.

Changes 2007-11-15 by Rainer Meier <skybeam (at) users.sourceforge.net>
FIX: Fixed always printing debug to event log (even if /debug was disabled).
NEW: The reboot=true attribute on an exit code forces an immediate reboot.
     Unfortunately all following commands are skipped then. Sometimes
     (maybe even more often) you might like to just set the package reboot
     flag depending on a command exit code. I introduced the support of
     reboot='delayed' within the command nodes. This allows to schedule a
     reboot instead of immediately executing it. The effect is the same
     as setting reboot='true' on package level (reboot after executing
     all comands. However it allows you to leave reboot='false' on package
     level and schedule a reboot based on command exit codes.
NEW: Added support for profile-based log level. You might use a profile node
     as follows:
     <profile id="profileID" logLevel="0xFF">
         ...
     </profile>
     If not specified it keeps the default log level. So final evaluation
     priority is as follows:
     - config.xml
     - command line parameter (/logLevel:<#>)
     - profile-specific logLevel
MOD: Upgrading to the latest package version before removing a package
     (if package is still available on server). This allows administrators
     to fix broken uninstall commands by supplying a new package with fixed
     commands. WPKG will now first do the upgrade and then execute the
     uninstall commands.

Changes 2007-11-14 by Rainer Meier <skybeam (at) users.sourceforge.net>
NEW: Modified logLevel parameter. Now acts as a bitmask which allows masking
     or unmasking of each severity level in its own. So for example it's
     possible mow to print only error, warning and debug by skipping info
     messages.
FIX: In case logLevel is set to 0 no output is written.
FIX: getPackageRevision() returns now "0" as a string instead of integer
     in case a package node does not have a revision attribute. This caused
     the version comparison of packages without revision attributes to fail
     since integers cannot be splitted by "." values ;-).
MOD: At initialization only warnings and errors are logged.
MOD: If a zombie package without reference from profile is removed it is
     removed from the local DB before a forced reboot (by exit code) takes
     place. This is done to avoid endless reboots in case the uninstall
     command returns the reboot command each time. Note that this can be
     disabled by the /noforcedremove switch. Moreover the package is NOT
     forced to be removed if the profile still has a reference to it (even
     if it is not within the package database any more).
MOD: Modified some getter methods to return default values for optional
     attributes instead of returning null.

Changes 2007-11-13 by Rainer Meier <skybeam (at) users.sourceforge.net>
NEW: Added printing version number with information-severirty to log at each
     start. This was added to ease support. Users should always use the
     latest version and including the version allows verifying it when a
     user attaches an execution log to Bugzilla.
MOD: Added trimming of splitted LCID values. This allows parsing of values
     even if spaces are used before/after the comma which separates the
     values.
MOD: Log entries written to an intermediate log file (before final log could
     be initialized) are moved to the new log file when a new log file is
     initialized. This assures that all messages will appear on the server.
     NOTE: In case there is a fatal error during initialization WPKG might
     be unable to initialize the final log file on the server. For example
     if you use the [PROFILE] naming template and profile.xml canot be read.
     The temporary log file is removed after moving log entries to the new
     log file.

Changes 2007-11-12 by Rainer Meier <skybeam (at) users.sourceforge.net>
FIX: Fixed user notification through windows messaging service. It was
     always skipped no matter what the "nonotify" value was set to. Fixed.
NEW: Added possibility to customize user messages (notifications) within
     config.xml. This change was proposed by Falko Trojahn and extended by
     myself. The idea is to localize at least the notification messages
     since they have to be read by the machine user. There are currently no
     intentions to localize all info/warning/error/debug messages. However
     it would be possible - but with a lot of effort and with quite small
     benefit.
     I already inserted translated messages for english and german LCIDs.
     French has been prepared as well (LCIDs) but the messages were not
     translated yet since my french might be funny to read but not make
     much sense ;-)
NEW: Added methods to read the system locale and to read the value of a
     corresponding localized string from a string ID within config.xml.
MOD: Failing to send a notify message will no longer force exit if
     /quitonerror is not set.
MOD: Since loading of XML nodes allow now to skip invalid XML files I added
     verification that at least one profile and one hosts definition is
     read. Without these information it makes no sense to continue so I
     force an immediate exit.
     This also fixes a problem where WPKG cannot read any XML files (share
     or wpkg_web not available) and it prints 3 error messages (about each
     database file) and quits after that. Finally this also speeds up
     canellaction of installation for road warriors with no network
     connection.
MOD: Moved position of the dinfo() method (as proposed by Leon Hedding).

Changes 2007-11-12 by Rainer Meier <skybeam (at) users.sourceforge.net>
MOD: Changed "notify" package attribute handling. Now by default (if
     attribute is missing) a notification is sent. This allows disabling of
     notification for a specific package by setting the notify="false"
     attribute.
     NOTE: It is still possible to disable notifications for ALL packages
          by using the /nonotify switch or disable notify within config.xml.

Changes 2007-11-12 by Rainer Meier <skybeam (at) users.sourceforge.net>
NEW: Allow use of [ss] within logfile pattern to allow creating of
     independent log file even if subsequent runs within the same minute.
MOD: Added seconds within timestamp for logfile output.
MOD: Changed the template of "hours" to lowercase [hh] which more clearly
     seperates hour/minutes/seconds templates from year/month/day values.

Changes 2007-11-10 by Rainer Meier <skybeam (at) users.sourceforge.net>
FIX: Fixed query all packages crash because of invalid statement.
NEW: WPKG does no longer stop parsing of XML files within folders in case of
     syntax errors. It just prints an error-severity message that the file is
     broken and and proceedes with the next file. In case /quitonerror is
     enabled it still exits immediately on XML load error.
     This fixes Bug 29.
MOD: Improved log file handling to assure that as much as possible is logged
     directly to the server.
MOD: Printing error number in hex format now in case of exception.
MOD: Query all packages will now print the total number of packages as well.
MOD: New setter and getter methods for data structure abstraction.

Changes 2007-11-09 by Rainer Meier <skybeam (at) users.sourceforge.net>
FIX: Fixed package reboot when package specifies exit code which initiates
     reboot at package uninstall. (NOTE: Package installation was not
     affected).
FIX: Reboot attribute within package did not have any effect. Fixed bug in
     isPackageReboot()
FIX: Cleanup is done before reboot now - this makes sure that local wpkg.xml
     is written before reboot takes place.
MOD: Fixed debug output typos.
MOD: Information printed during package installation revised to allow better
     debugging.
MOD: Removed getPackageReboot() in favor of isPackageReboot() and integrated
     it within installPackage() - code reusage enhancement.

Changes 2007-11-08 by Rainer Meier <skybeam (at) users.sourceforge.net>
MOD: Modified install procedure. In case a package is not within the local
     settings it checks if the package checks return true (package
     installed) before it is installed. This was done to prevent re-
     installing all packages in case of a lost local wpkg.xml.
     Unfortunately this introduces a small chance that in case a new version
     is added to the package database AND the local wpkg.xml is deleted AND
     the check for the new package yields true for an old installation as
     well that the new package does not get installed. However in any case
     the next upgrade will fix that.
     I still added the changes since the advantages wight much heavier than
     the disadvantages of re-installing every package in case of lost local
     database.
     NOTE: This will not prevent packages without checks to be re-installed
     if no package checks are provided.
MOD: Revised debug messages printed by installPackage() to allow easier
     debugging for errors reported when debug log file is attached.
MOD: Installation of dependencies moved to separate function for better
     (code re-usage).
FIX: Package version comparison caused exception if one of the packages had
     no revision defined. Changed getPackageRevision() to return "0" for all
     packages where no revision is defined.
     Thanks to Falko Trojahn for reporting.
FIX: installPackage() returned false (failed installation) in case it found
     that a package is already installed (same revision within package
     database and wpkg.xml). This was causing dependeny installations to
     fail if the dependency was installed already. Fixed, installPackage()
     returns true now in case the specified package is already installed.
     Thanks to Falko Trojahn for reporting.
FIX: Adding a cloned node from package database to settings file instead
     of the node directly. Thes lead to the fact that the node disappeared
     within the package database and was therefore not available within the
     cached database any more. It looks like XML nodes are removed from any
     other node when "appended" to another node using appendChild().

Changes 2007-11-06 by Rainer Meier <skybeam (at) users.sourceforge.net>
FIX: Removed echo statement which I used for debug purposes.
NEW: Allowing matching of IP-addresses within the profile name now. The
     format has to be specified as follows:
     <start>[-<end>].<start>[-<end>].<start>[-<end>].<start>[-<end>]
     examples:
     192.168.1.1
     192.168.1.1-254
     192.168.1-5.20-50

     Re-Used code from scanUninstallKeys() to retrieve IP address from the
     registry. According to my knowledge there is no direct interface within
     WScript to access the local IP adress(es).
FIX: Fixed some null reference problems in case package DB is inconsistent.
FIX: Fixed bug where a package referenced within the profile but neither
     installed (available in wpkg.xml) nor within the package database
     (packages.xml) caused a null pointer exception.
MOD: Sorting setting nodes before saving settings. This allows easier diff
     of XML files on server. See
     <http://wpkg.org/Viewing_software_installed_on_workstations>
     for more information.
MOD: Fixed some typo and output cosmetics reported by Falko Trojahn.

Changes 2007-11-06 by Rainer Meier <skybeam (ag) users.sourceforge.net>
FIX: Change for optional config.xml has broken config file reading in case
     config.xml was not stored directly within the current working folder.
     The code has been altered now to search for config.xml within the
     directory where wpkg.js is called from. So if you execute the script
     by using '\\server\share\wpkg.js' it looks for
     '\\server\share\config.xml'. Still if it does not exist it is silently
     ignored and default values are used.
FIX: Implemented fix for Bug 12 - getRegistryValue() returns the key default
     value if a path to a key is specified. If the "(default)" entry is not
     set it returns an empty string (""). Still returns null in case no such
     registry entry could be located (neither key nor value).
MOD: Added some more debug output.

Changes 2007-11-05 by Rainer Meier <skybeam (ag) users.sourceforge.net>
FIX: Usage of [PROFILE] tag was described within the /logfilePattern
     documentation but not implemented. Added implementation.
FIX: Temporary log file at WPKG startup (written to %TEMP%) is now properly
     closed.
FIX: Modified regular expression to replace CR/LF with pipes for logfile
     output (was matching LF only before).
FIX: Log file timestamp now contains log severity.
MOD: Error in case of failed XML file read is now printed in one message
     instead of splitting it to several event log entries.
MOD: Debug output is not any more coupled with logLevel. A log level of 16
     will log debug output even if /debug is not set. This allows running
     the script on clients with default log level while writing a debug
     log file to the log directory. This is handy to prevent polluting the
     client event log with wpkg messages.
MOD: Integraded changes from version 0.9.12-test 3:
     - config.xml is now optional.
     - Bug 75: Failed to check file revision could not be retrieved.
MOD: Optimized getProfile(), caching value now instead of re-evaluating
     on each call.
 *
Changes 2007-11-04 by Rainer Meier <skybeam (at) users.sourceforge.net>
FIX: Fixed package query. Compares package ID now to get installed status
     instead of comparing references (which returns false when comparing
     node from pacakge database and node from settings).
NEW: Introduced new set*(), is*() and get*() methods to query script
     parameters. Direct field access should be avoided.
NEW: Introduced ability to write a log file to a specified directory. This
     allows administrator to have clients writing a log file to a shared
     directory to trace client execution.
NEW: Log-file naming pattern is configurable in order to allow having one
     log file per client, one log file per day/hour/minute...
NEW: Configurable log level allows administrators to change level of log
     detail within config.xml (or overridden by command line switch).
NEW: Zombie packages will be removed from the local package database even if
     locally stored uninstall string fails. Except if the package is still
     referenced in the applying profile. In such a case a message about
     message about inconsitency between profiles and the package database is
     printed. This makes sure that a package does not generate a recurring
     error on each boot (when using wpkg-service) in case the package has
     been completely removed from the server.
     In case you like to disable this have a look at the /noforcedremove
     switch.
NEW: Using versionCompare() now to compare versions of packages. This allows
     usage of string representation of revision attribute on each package.
     Currently wpkg_web supports just integer values but this could be
     changed.
MOD: Removed some redundant code.
MOD: Removed all XML node handling to get* methods to simplify XML handling.
MOD: Saving settings XML file just once (on exit) instead of several times.
MOD: Unified logging, info(), dinfo(), warning() and error() use the log()
     method now which can handle the output in one single place.
MOD: query*() methods now rely on the same code. Unifies output formatting
     and siplifies maintenance.
MOD: Does not stop execution in case a package fails installation except if
     /quitonerror flag is set.
MOD: installPackage() (package installation) makes sure all dependencies are
     installed first. In case a dependency failed the package installation
     fails as well.
MOD: installPackage() now acts more intelligent and detects if a package
     needs to be installed, upgraded or skipped. It also takes into account
     the package execution flag ("always" or "once"). Therefore the
     upgradePackage() and executeOnce() methods which mainly contained
     duplicated code are removed. Just call installPackage() for each
     package which applies to the system no matter if it is already
     installed or not.
MOD: Splitted script parameter evaluation and initialization.
MOD: Added lots of comments and documentation.
MOD: Some code reformating.
